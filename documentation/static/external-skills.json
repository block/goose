Default to automatic file naming, use `--filename=` when artifact is a part of the workflow result.\n\n## Browser Sessions\n\n```bash\n# create new browser session named \"mysession\" with persistent profile\nplaywright-cli -s=mysession open example.com --persistent\n# same with manually specified profile directory (use when requested explicitly)\nplaywright-cli -s=mysession open example.com --profile=/path/to/profile\nplaywright-cli -s=mysession click e6\nplaywright-cli -s=mysession close  # stop a named browser\nplaywright-cli -s=mysession delete-data  # delete user data for persistent session\n\nplaywright-cli list\n# Close all browsers\nplaywright-cli close-all\n# Forcefully kill all browser processes\nplaywright-cli kill-all\n```\n\n## Local installation\n\nIn some cases user might want to install playwright-cli locally. If running globally available `playwright-cli` binary fails, use `npx playwright-cli` to run the commands. For example:\n\n```bash\nnpx playwright-cli open https://example.com\nnpx playwright-cli click e1\n```\n\n## Example: Form submission\n\n```bash\nplaywright-cli open https://example.com/form\nplaywright-cli snapshot\n\nplaywright-cli fill e1 \"user@example.com\"\nplaywright-cli fill e2 \"password123\"\nplaywright-cli click e3\nplaywright-cli snapshot\nplaywright-cli close\n```\n\n## Example: Multi-tab workflow\n\n```bash\nplaywright-cli open https://example.com\nplaywright-cli tab-new https://example.com/other\nplaywright-cli tab-list\nplaywright-cli tab-select 0\nplaywright-cli snapshot\nplaywright-cli close\n```\n\n## Example: Debugging with DevTools\n\n```bash\nplaywright-cli open https://example.com\nplaywright-cli click e4\nplaywright-cli fill e7 \"test\"\nplaywright-cli console\nplaywright-cli network\nplaywright-cli close\n```\n\n```bash\nplaywright-cli open https://example.com\nplaywright-cli tracing-start\nplaywright-cli click e4\nplaywright-cli fill e7 \"test\"\nplaywright-cli tracing-stop\nplaywright-cli close\n```\n\n## Specific tasks\n\n* **Request mocking** [references/request-mocking.md](references/request-mocking.md)\n* **Running Playwright code** [references/running-code.md](references/running-code.md)\n* **Browser session management** [references/session-management.md](references/session-management.md)\n* **Storage state (cookies, localStorage)** [references/storage-state.md](references/storage-state.md)\n* **Test generation** [references/test-generation.md](references/test-generation.md)\n* **Tracing** [references/tracing.md](references/tracing.md)\n* **Video recording** [references/video-recording.md](references/video-recording.md)\n"
