## Configuration

:::info
Note that you'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your system to run this command, as it uses `npx`.
:::


<Tabs groupId="interface">
  <TabItem value="ui" label="Goose Desktop" default>
  <GooseDesktopInstaller
    extensionId="selenium-mcp"
    extensionName="Selenium MCP"
    description="automates browser interactions"
    command="npx"
    args={["-y", "@angiejones/mcp-selenium"]}
  />
</TabItem>
  <TabItem value="cli" label="Goose CLI">
  1. Run the `configure` command:
  ```sh
  goose configure
  ```

  2. Choose to add a `Command-line Extension`
  ```sh
    ┌   goose-configure 
    │
    ◇  What would you like to configure?
    │  Add Extension (Connect to a new extension) 
    │
    ◆  What type of extension would you like to add?
    │  ○ Built-in Extension 
    // highlight-start    
    │  ● Command-line Extension (Run a local command or script)
    // highlight-end    
    │  ○ Remote Extension (SSE) 
    │  ○ Remote Extension (Streaming HTTP) 
    └ 
  ```

  3. Give your extension a name
  ```sh
    ┌   goose-configure 
    │
    ◇  What would you like to configure?
    │  Add Extension (Connect to a new extension) 
    │
    ◇  What type of extension would you like to add?
    │  Command-line Extension 
    │
    // highlight-start
    ◆  What would you like to call this extension?
    │  Selenium
    // highlight-end
    └ 
  ```

  4. Enter the command
  ```sh
    ┌   goose-configure

    // highlight-start
    ◆  What command should be run?
    │  npx -y @angiejones/mcp-selenium
    // highlight-end
    └ 
  ```  

  5. Enter the number of seconds Goose should wait for actions to complete before timing out. Default is 300s
    ```sh
    ┌   goose-configure

    │
    // highlight-start
    ◆  Please set the timeout for this tool (in secs):
    │  300
    // highlight-end
    │
    └ 
  ``` 

  6. Choose to add a description. If you select "Yes" here, you will be prompted to enter a description for the extension.
    ```sh

    // highlight-end
    │
    └

</Tabs>

## Example Usage

Let's use Goose to build a test automation project from scratch! We'll use the Selenium MCP to automate filling out a web form, then have Goose generate a Selenium project with the code so that we can run these tests again when needed.


### Goose Prompt

> Use selenium to go to the heroku formy site and fill out the form page with generic data. then can you turn what you've done into an automation script for me? I would like it in Java. Also use the Page Object Model pattern.
