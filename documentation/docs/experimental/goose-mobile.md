## Key Features

- **Automation**: Automate multi-step tasks using installed apps.
- **Notification Handling**: Respond to incoming notifications based on set rules.
- **Extensibility**: Discover and use extensions from other apps to perform background tasks.

## Getting Started

Goose Mobile is a research project and not intended for production use. It's recommended to try it on a spare Android phone or an emulator.

### Installation Options

- **Pre-built APK**: Quickly install via [Firebase distribution link](https://appdistribution.firebase.google.com/pub/i/3f111ea732d5f7f6).
- **Build from Source**: For developers, instructions are available in the [Goose Mobile repository](https://github.com/block/goose-mobile).

## Extending Goose Mobile

Goose Mobile supports extensions via the "mobile MCP" system, allowing it to use tools from other apps without switching contexts. For example, it can use a weather extension to quickly fetch weather information.

Example extension code and setup can be found in the repository's [README](https://github.com/block/goose-mobile).
