## Overview

Goose is an open source project that is constantly being improved and expanded upon. This leads to new features and projects and some of these features / projects are considered experimental, meaning they are still in development and may not be fully stable or ready for production use. This area highlights some of our experimental features and projects we want to explore further.

:::note
The list of experimental features may change as Goose development progresses. Some features may be promoted to stable features, while others might be modified or removed.This section will be updated with specific experimental features as they become available
