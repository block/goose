introduction to using Ollama on Windows goes here, link to the other installation guides for Goose
- eg, using CPU/RAM only with no dedicated GPU will be much slower, but may allow for larger models to fit in memory
- not a place to get into NVIDIA vs AMD discussion, but we could recommend various hardware configurations

## Setup

talk about the hardware used for testing, any specific hardware setup you needed to do like setting up the Windows Defender firewall etc.
