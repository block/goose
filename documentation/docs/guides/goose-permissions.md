# Managing Goose Modes

Goose’s permissions determine how much autonomy it has when modifying files, using extensions, and performing automated actions. By selecting a permission mode, you have full control over how Goose interacts with your development environment.

## Permission Modes

| Mode             | Description                                                                                             | Best For                                                                               |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Auto Mode**    | Goose can modify files, use extensions, and delete files **without requiring approval**.                | Users who want **full automation** and seamless integration into their workflow.       |
| **Approve Mode** | Goose **asks for confirmation** before all tools and extensions. | Users who want to **review and approve** any changes and extension use before they happen. |
| **Chat Mode**    | Goose **only engages in chat**, with no extension use or file modifications.                            | Users who prefer a **conversational AI experience** without automation.                |

:::warning
`Auto Mode` is applied by default.

  <TabItem value="ui" label="Goose Desktop">

    You can change modes before or during a session and it will take effect immediately.

    **From Settings**

    1. Click `...` in the upper right corner
    2. Click `Settings`
    3. Under `Mode Selection`, choose the mode you'd like

    **Within Session**

    Click the Goose Mode option from the bottom menu. 
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

  :::info
  If you choose `Approve` mode, you will see "Allow" and "Deny" buttons in your session windows during tool calls. Goose will only ask for permission for tools that it deems are 'write' tools, e.g. any 'text editor write', 'text editor edit', 'bash - rm, cp, mv' commands. 
  
  Read/write approval makes best effort attempt at classifying read or write tools. This is interpreted by your LLM provider.
