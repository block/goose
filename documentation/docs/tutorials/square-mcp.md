This tutorial will get you started with the [open-source Square MCP Server](https://github.com/square/square-mcp-server) as a Goose extension to enable interactive work for your Square seller account!


:::tip TLDR

**Command**
```sh
npx -y square-mcp-server start
```

**Environment Variables**
```
ACCESS_TOKEN: <YOUR_API_KEY>
SANDBOX: <true/false>

## Example Usage

The Square MCP server allows you to interact with Square's connect API with an extensive [service catalog](https://github.com/square/square-mcp-server?tab=readme-ov-file#service-catalog) to access the Square API ecosystem.

#### Goose Prompt

```
( O)> Find my food menu from the following image and import these into my Square seller account. "my-burger-menu.png"
```

[Here's the menu image used in the demo.](../assets/guides/square-mcp-goosin-menu.png)

#### Goose Output

```
I'll help you import these menu items into your Square catalog. I'll use the Square API to create catalog items for each burger. Let me break this down into steps:

1. First, I'll check the catalog API service info and types
2. Then I'll create catalog items for each burger

Now let me check the type info for creating catalog objects

Now I'll start creating catalog items for each burger in your menu. I'll create them one by one using the catalog API. Let me process each burger:

(output truncated)

I've successfully created all the burger items from your menu in your Square catalog. Each burger has been added with:

- The exact name from your menu
- The full description
- The correct price
- A standard variation for ordering

Here's a summary of what was created:
- The Classic - $10.00
- Cheeseburger - $11.00
- Primetime Burger - $12.00
- Double Bacon - $14.00
- Texas Meatlover - $12.50
- Buffalo Burger - $12.00
- The Atomic - $12.50
- Little Bird - $11.00
- Mushroom Burger - $10.00

All items are now available in your Square catalog and ready for use in your point of sale system. Each burger includes its complete description and comes with a "Regular" variation at the specified price. The items are set as both sellable and stockable by default, and they're available at all locations.
