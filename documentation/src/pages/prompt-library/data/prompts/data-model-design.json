Here's my verbal description of the data model requirements: We're building a task management system for a software development team. We need to track:\n- Projects with multiple tasks\n- Task assignments to team members\n- Task dependencies\n- Time estimates and actual time spent\n- Task status changes and history\n- Comments and attachments on tasks\n- Sprint/milestone assignments\n\n2. Can you help me transform this into a concrete implementation?\n\n3. Let's validate this against the following use cases:\n- Team lead creates a new project and adds initial tasks\n- Developer updates task status and logs time\n- QA adds a blocking issue that depends on another task\n- Manager generates sprint velocity report\n- Team member adds comments and attachments to tasks\n- System needs to track task history for auditing\n- Tasks need to be easily searchable by various criteria\n\n4. We'll need to be able to iterate on this design based on our findings",
