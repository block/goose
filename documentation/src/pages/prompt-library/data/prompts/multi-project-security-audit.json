  "example_prompt": "Please analyze these codebases for security issues:\n\n1. Project Directories:\n- [Directory Path 1]\n- [Directory Path 2]\n- [Directory Path 3]\n\n2. Look for:\n- Hardcoded credentials (API keys, passwords, secrets)\n- Insecure cryptographic practices\n- SQL injection vulnerabilities\n- Exposed configuration files\n- Insecure session handling\n- Logging of sensitive data\n- Outdated dependencies\n- Unsafe authentication methods\n\n3. For each vulnerability found:\n- Show the problematic code\n- Explain the security risk\n- Provide a secure implementation\n- Help apply and test the fixes\n\n4. Create a detailed security report including:\n- Critical findings by project\n- Risk severity levels\n- File locations and snippets\n- Applied fixes and improvements\n- Verification steps taken",
