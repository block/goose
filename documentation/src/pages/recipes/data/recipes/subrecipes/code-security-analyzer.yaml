prompt: |
  Analyze {{ project_path }} for security vulnerabilities with {{ analysis_depth }} depth and {{ compliance_standard }} compliance standard.
  
  Workflow:
  1. Language Detection
     - Identify primary programming languages used
     - Detect frameworks and libraries
     - Determine analysis rules based on {{ language_focus }}
     - Exclude test files unless {{ include_tests }} == "true"
  
  2. Static Analysis
     - Scan for common vulnerability patterns:
       * Injection vulnerabilities (SQL, NoSQL, LDAP, OS command)
       * Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - stored, reflected, DOM-based
       * Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
       * Insecure Direct Object References
       * Security Misconfiguration
       * Sensitive Data Exposure
       * Missing Function Level Access Control
       * Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
       * Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities
       * Underprotected APIs
  
  3. Authentication & Authorization Analysis
     - Check for weak authentication mechanisms
     - Identify missing or weak session management
     - Detect privilege escalation vulnerabilities
     - Analyze access control implementations
     - Check for hardcoded credentials or tokens
  
  4. Input Validation Analysis
     - Identify missing input validation
     - Check for proper output encoding
     - Detect buffer overflow risks
     - Analyze file upload security
     - Check for path traversal vulnerabilities
  
  5. Data Protection Analysis
     - Check for sensitive data exposure
     - Identify weak encryption implementations
     - Detect insecure data storage
     - Analyze data transmission security
     - Check for proper key management
  
  6. Framework-Specific Analysis
     {% if language_focus == "javascript" or language_focus == "auto" %}
     - Node.js/Express security issues
     - React/Vue/Angular XSS vulnerabilities
     - NPM package security
     - Client-side security issues
     {% endif %}
     {% if language_focus == "python" or language_focus == "auto" %}
     - Django/Flask security patterns
     - Python-specific vulnerabilities
     - WSGI security issues
     - Package security analysis
     {% endif %}
     {% if language_focus == "java" or language_focus == "auto" %}
     - Spring Security configurations
     - Java-specific vulnerabilities
     - Servlet security issues
     - Maven/Gradle dependency security
     {% endif %}
     {% if language_focus == "go" or language_focus == "auto" %}
     - Go-specific security patterns
     - Goroutine security issues
     - Package security analysis
     - Memory safety issues
     {% endif %}
     {% if language_focus == "rust" or language_focus == "auto" %}
     - Rust memory safety analysis
     - Unsafe code usage
     - Cargo dependency security
     - Concurrency security issues
     {% endif %}
  
  7. Report Generation
     - Create detailed security analysis report
     - Include:
       * Vulnerability type and severity
       * File path and line numbers
       * Code snippets and context
       * Risk assessment and impact
       * Remediation recommendations
       * Compliance mapping
  
  8. Memory Storage
     - Store security findings in memory
     - Track code quality trends over time
     - Compare with previous analyses
  
  Security Patterns to Detect:
  - SQL Injection: Dynamic queries, string concatenation
  - XSS: Unescaped output, innerHTML usage
  - CSRF: Missing tokens, unsafe methods
  - Authentication: Weak passwords, session fixation
  - Authorization: Missing checks, privilege escalation
  - Input Validation: Missing sanitization, type confusion
  - Cryptography: Weak algorithms, hardcoded keys
  - Error Handling: Information disclosure, stack traces
  
  Remediation Recommendations:
  - Use parameterized queries for database access
  - Implement proper output encoding
  - Add CSRF protection tokens
  - Implement strong authentication mechanisms
  - Add proper access control checks
  - Validate and sanitize all inputs
  - Use strong cryptographic algorithms
  - Implement secure error handling
  
  Focus on:
  - Critical vulnerabilities that could lead to data breaches
  - Authentication and authorization flaws
  - Input validation issues
  - Framework-specific security misconfigurations
  - Dependencies with known vulnerabilities
