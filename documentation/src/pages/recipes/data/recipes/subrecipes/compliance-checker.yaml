  Workflow:
  1. Standard Selection and Mapping
     {% if standard == "owasp-top10" %}
     - Map findings against OWASP Top 10 categories:
       * A01: Broken Access Control
       * A02: Cryptographic Failures
       * A03: Injection
       * A04: Insecure Design
       * A05: Security Misconfiguration
       * A06: Vulnerable and Outdated Components
       * A07: Identification and Authentication Failures
       * A08: Software and Data Integrity Failures
       * A09: Security Logging and Monitoring Failures
       * A10: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
     {% elif standard == "owasp-asvs" %}
     - Map findings against OWASP ASVS {{ compliance_level }}:
       * V1: Architecture, Design and Threat Modeling
       * V2: Authentication
       * V3: Session Management
       * V4: Access Control
       * V5: Malicious Input Handling
       * V6: Cryptography
       * V7: Error Handling and Logging
       * V8: Data Protection
       * V9: Communications
       * V10: Malicious Controls
       * V11: Business Logic
       * V12: Files and Resources
       * V13: API
       * V14: Configuration
     {% elif standard == "cwe-top25" %}
     - Map findings against CWE Top 25:
       * CWE-79: Cross-site Scripting
       * CWE-89: SQL Injection
       * CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size
       * CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery
       * CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type
       * CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference
       * CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data
       * CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write
       * CWE-862: Missing Authorization
       * CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization
     {% elif standard == "pci-dss" %}
     - Map findings against PCI-DSS requirements:
       * Requirement 1: Install and maintain network security controls
       * Requirement 2: Apply secure configurations
       * Requirement 3: Protect stored cardholder data
       * Requirement 4: Encrypt transmission of cardholder data
       * Requirement 5: Protect all systems against malware
       * Requirement 6: Develop and maintain secure systems
       * Requirement 7: Restrict access by business need to know
       * Requirement 8: Identify and authenticate access
       * Requirement 9: Restrict physical access to cardholder data
       * Requirement 10: Log and monitor all access
       * Requirement 11: Regularly test security systems
       * Requirement 12: Maintain information security policy
     {% elif standard == "sox" %}
     - Map findings against SOX compliance requirements:

  2. Compliance Assessment
     - Analyze project architecture and design
     - Review security controls implementation
     - Assess data protection mechanisms
     - Evaluate access control systems
     - Check logging and monitoring capabilities
     - Validate encryption and key management
  
  3. Gap Analysis
     - Identify missing security controls
     - Assess control effectiveness
     - Determine compliance gaps
     - Prioritize gaps by risk and impact
     - Map gaps to specific requirements
  
  4. Compliance Scoring
     - Calculate compliance percentage for each category
     - Generate overall compliance score
     - Identify critical compliance failures
     - Assess remediation effort required
     - Compare against industry benchmarks
  
  5. Report Generation
     - Create {{ output_format }} compliance report
     - Include:
       * Executive summary and compliance score
       * Detailed findings by category
       * Gap analysis results
       * Risk assessment and impact
       {% if include_remediation == "true" %}
       * Remediation recommendations
       * Implementation roadmap
       * Resource requirements
       {% endif %}
       {% if audit_mode == "true" %}
       * Audit-ready documentation
       * Evidence collection guidance
       * Control testing procedures
       {% endif %}
  
  6. Memory Storage
     - Store compliance findings in memory
     - Track compliance progress over time
     - Compare with previous assessments
     - Maintain compliance history
  
  Compliance Categories:
  - Authentication and Authorization
  - Data Protection and Encryption
  - Input Validation and Output Encoding
  - Error Handling and Logging
  - Session Management
  - Access Control
  - Cryptographic Controls
  - Network Security
  - Configuration Management
  - Incident Response
  
  Remediation Priorities:
  - Critical: Immediate action required
  - High: Address within 30 days
  - Medium: Address within 90 days
  - Low: Address within 6 months
  
  Focus on:
  - Controls that directly impact compliance requirements
  - Gaps that could lead to audit failures
  - Missing controls for critical business functions
  - Ineffective controls that need improvement
  
  Generate actionable recommendations for achieving and maintaining compliance.
