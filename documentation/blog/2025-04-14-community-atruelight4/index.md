As the goose team continues to work on new features over 800 community members voted to express their need for Goose on Windows. Today's top contributor stepped in to aid this ongoing effort.

## Windows Support

Since the launch of codename goose, the open source community has been wanting and requesting the same automation by goose on Windows.

Currently, goose's CLI version works on Windows with limited built-in extensions via WSL, or Windows Subsystem for Linux. While there is a limited internal beta in the works, there are several bugs and improvements that are being worked on to ensure codename goose has the same seamless experience as it does on Mac.

## ATrueLight4's Goose4Win

Our featured contributor, ATrueLight4, contributed Goose4Win, an effort that improves Windows-specific path handling. Their contribution was merged into main, which means if you download goose for CLI on Windows right now? You donâ€™t need to install anything else to enjoy this change.

Now when you run goose CLI on Windows, you wonâ€™t run into path navigation issues, like when you try to get Goose to look at specific folders. Thank you so much for your contribution, ATrueLight4! Your work brings us one step closer to Goose on Windows.
