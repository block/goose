## 🎯 TL;DR

**Problem**: We have two PRs that each solve part of the onboarding problem:
- PR #4950: Beautiful UI, but only checks key format
- PR #5147: Smart detection, but has race conditions and ugly UI

**Solution**: Combine the beautiful UI from #4950 with the backend intelligence from #5147 (after fixing race conditions).

**Result**: Users get a gorgeous onboarding experience with keys that actually work!
