# Current Status & Next Steps

## âœ… What's Implemented (Working)

### 1. Triple Backtick Code Blocks
- Type ` ```python ` â†’ code â†’ ` ``` `
- Renders with full IDE-style syntax highlighting
- VS Code dark theme
- Language badges
- **Status**: Complete and working

## ðŸŽ¯ What You Want (Next Feature)

### Live IDE Input with `#language` Trigger

**User Experience:**
1. Type `#python` in chat input
2. Everything after becomes a live code editor
3. Syntax highlighting **as you type**
4. Enter = newline (not send)
5. Cmd+Enter = finish and send

**Why This is Better:**
- More intuitive than triple backticks
- Live feedback while typing
- Clearer visual indication of "code mode"
- Better for quick code snippets

## ðŸš§ Implementation Complexity

This requires:
1. **State management** for code mode
2. **Real-time syntax highlighting** (performance considerations)
3. **Keyboard event overrides** (Enter behavior)
4. **Visual mode indicators**
5. **Cursor position management** in code mode

## ðŸ’¡ Recommendation

Given the time constraints and complexity, I suggest:

### Option 1: Ship Current Feature First âœ…
- The triple backtick version works great
- Users can test and provide feedback
- Build the `#language` trigger as v2

### Option 2: Quick Prototype
- Implement basic `#python` detection
- Simple syntax highlighting (may have performance issues)
- Iterate based on testing

### Option 3: Full Implementation
- Complete live IDE experience
- Requires significant testing
- 2-3 hours of focused work

## ðŸŽ¬ Your Call

What would you like to do?
1. **Test current implementation** (triple backticks) and create PR?
2. **Quick prototype** of `#language` trigger (30-45 min)?
3. **Full implementation** of live IDE input (2-3 hours)?

The current code block feature is solid and ready to use. The `#language` trigger would be a great enhancement but requires more work to get right.
