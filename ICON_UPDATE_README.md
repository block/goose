# fix/iconII Branch - Icon Composer Integration

## Branch Purpose
This branch was created to integrate the Icon Composer icon project located at:
`/Users/spencermartin/Desktop/Gooseicon.icon`

## Current Status

### Analysis Completed
- ✅ Icon Composer project examined
- ✅ Glyph.svg compared: **IDENTICAL** to current version
- ✅ Icon.svg compared: **IDENTICAL** to current version  
- ✅ Branch created from latest main (with fix/dock-icon-border merged)
- ✅ Backup created: `ui/desktop/src/images.backup`

### Icon Composer Project Details

**Location:** `/Users/spencermartin/Desktop/Gooseicon.icon`

**Contents:**
- `Assets/glyph.svg` - Same as current glyph
- `icon.json` - Configuration with visual effects:
  - Glass effect enabled
  - Translucency: 50%
  - Shadow: neutral, 50% opacity
  - Light/dark mode color variations
  - Platform support: watchOS circles, shared squares

**Key Insight:** The Icon Composer project uses the same SVG source but adds macOS-specific visual effects (glass, translucency, shadows) that are rendered at build time.

## Next Steps

### Option A: Export from Icon Composer (Recommended for macOS app icon)
1. Xcode has been opened with the project
2. Export the icon:
   - In Xcode: Product > Export, or
   - Right-click asset > Export
3. Save exported `.icns` to Desktop
4. Run integration script (to be created)

### Option B: Use Current Icons (No Changes Needed)
Since the SVG sources are identical, the current icons are already up-to-date. The Icon Composer effects are primarily for iOS/watchOS app icons.

### Option C: Regenerate Icons
```bash
cd ui/desktop/src/images
./prepare.sh
```

## Files Modified
- None yet (backup created)

## Files to Update (if proceeding with Option A)
- `ui/desktop/src/images/icon.icns` (234 KB → new export)
- Potentially other icon formats if the visual effects improve appearance

## Commands

### View current icons
```bash
ls -lh ui/desktop/src/images/icon*
```

### Restore backup if needed
```bash
rm -rf ui/desktop/src/images
mv ui/desktop/src/images.backup ui/desktop/src/images
```

### Regenerate all icons from SVG
```bash
cd ui/desktop/src/images
./prepare.sh
```

## Notes
- Icon Composer projects (.icon) require Xcode for export
- The visual effects (glass, translucency) are macOS-specific rendering features
- Current icons were last updated: Oct 21-25, 2025
- The glyph.svg is used for menu bar/tray icons
- The icon.svg is used for main application icon
