This is a rust project with crates in the crates/ dir. 

ui/desktop has an electron app in typescript. 

Pro tips: 
- Review the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file in the root of the project for dev workflows.
- We want short iteration loops with one or two clear tasks between giving me back control to verify progress is on the right track.
- Use `git status` and `git diff` to review any current changes
- Use `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` to make sure any rust code changes are valid
- in ui/desktop, look at how you can run lint checks and if other tests can run
