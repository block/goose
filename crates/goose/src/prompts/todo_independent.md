- [ ] Write original prompt VERBATIM to .task_prompt.md (IMMEDIATE - context degrades - this is ALWAYS YOUR FIRST ACTION)
- [ ] Write every explicit requirement and success criterion from the prompt to .task_reqs.md
- [ ] Write every edge case and potential blocker to .task_edges.md
- [ ] Add every implicit requirement and success criterion to .task_reqs.md
- [ ] Write a minimal implementation plan that meets all requirements to .task_plan.md
- [ ] Implement: integration (you) | Independent modules (subagents, batch≤10)
- [ ] Read .task_prompt.md and .task_reqs.md then test EVERY requirement → Fix until 100%
