The model is designed for extended autonomous operation, maintaining task continuity across sessions and providing fact-based progress tracking.\n\nSonnet 4.5 also introduces stronger agentic capabilities, including improved tool orchestration, speculative parallel execution, and more efficient context and memory management. With enhanced context tracking and awareness of token usage across tool calls, it is particularly well-suited for multi-context and long-running workflows. Use cases span software engineering, cybersecurity, financial analysis, research agents, and other domains requiring sustained reasoning and tool use.",

Leveraging innovations like Per-Layer Embedding (PLE) caching and the MatFormer architecture, Gemma 3n dynamically manages memory usage and computational load by selectively activating model parameters, significantly reducing runtime resource requirements.\n\nThis model supports a wide linguistic range (trained in over 140 languages) and features a flexible 32K token context window. Gemma 3n can selectively load parameters, optimizing memory and computational efficiency based on the task or device capabilities, making it well-suited for privacy-focused, offline-capable applications and on-device AI solutions.

Compared to GPT-5, Codex is more steerable, adheres closely to developer instructions, and produces cleaner, higher-quality code outputs. Reasoning effort can be adjusted with the `reasoning.effort` parameter. Read the [docs here](https://openrouter.ai/docs/use-cases/reasoning-tokens#reasoning-effort-level)\n\nCodex integrates into developer environments including the CLI, IDE extensions, GitHub, and cloud tasks. It adapts reasoning effort dynamically—providing fast responses for small tasks while sustaining extended multi-hour runs for large projects. The model is trained to perform structured code reviews, catching critical flaws by reasoning over dependencies and validating behavior against tests. It also supports multimodal inputs such as images or screenshots for UI development and integrates tool use for search, dependency installation, and environment setup.

    "description": "OpenAI o3-mini-high is the same model as [o3-mini](/openai/o3-mini) with reasoning_effort set to high. \n\no3-mini is a cost-efficient language model optimized for STEM reasoning tasks, particularly excelling in science, mathematics, and coding. The model features three adjustable reasoning effort levels and supports key developer capabilities including function calling, structured outputs, and streaming, though it does not include vision processing capabilities.\n\nThe model demonstrates significant improvements over its predecessor, with expert testers preferring its responses 56% of the time and noting a 39% reduction in major errors on complex questions. With medium reasoning effort settings, o3-mini matches the performance of the larger o1 model on challenging reasoning evaluations like AIME and GPQA, while maintaining lower latency and cost.",
