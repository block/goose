description: Reference goose documentation to create, configure, or explain goose-specific features like recipes, extensions, sessions, and providers
---

Use this skill when working with **goose-specific features**:
- Creating or editing recipes
- Configuring extensions or providers
- Explaining how goose features work
- Any goose configuration or setup task

Do NOT use this skill for:
- General coding tasks unrelated to goose
- Running existing recipes (just run them directly)

## Steps

1. Fetch the goose documentation map from: `http://localhost:3000/goose/goose-docs-map.md`

2. Scan the headings to identify which page(s) are relevant to the user's task

3. Use the documentation to help the user:
   - **If creating/modifying something:** Draft the recipe/config, show the user, and ask for confirmation before making changes
   - **If explaining something:** Present the information clearly and offer to help with follow-up tasks
