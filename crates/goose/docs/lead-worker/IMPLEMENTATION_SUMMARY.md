# Lead/Worker Model Logging Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented comprehensive logging for the lead/worker feature that shows all models being used at startup and when switching models.

## Changes Made

### 1. Core Implementation (`crates/goose/src/providers/`)

#### `base.rs`
- Added `LeadWorkerProviderTrait` with `get_model_info()` method
- Added `as_lead_worker()` method to `Provider` trait for type checking

#### `lead_worker.rs`
- Implemented `LeadWorkerProviderTrait` for `LeadWorkerProvider`
- Added `as_lead_worker()` override method
- Enhanced logging with `tracing::info!` and `tracing::warn!` calls
- Confirmed switch-back logic is working correctly

#### `factory.rs`
- Added support for YAML configuration with `LeadWorkerConfig` struct
- Implemented precedence order: Environment variables > YAML config > Regular provider
- Added configuration validation and error handling

### 2. CLI Integration (`crates/goose-cli/src/session/`)

#### `builder.rs`
- Added startup logging in `build_session()` function
- Detects lead/worker mode and displays model information
- Shows clear indication of auto-fallback capability

### 3. Documentation (`crates/goose/docs/lead-worker/`)

#### Files Created:
- `README.md` - Quick start guide and overview
- `LEAD_WORKER_FEATURE.md` - Complete feature documentation
- `example-config.yaml` - Example YAML configuration
- `test_lead_worker_feature.sh` - Basic functionality test script
- `test_lead_worker_logging.sh` - Logging-specific test script
- `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - This summary document

## Key Features Implemented

### âœ… Startup Logging
**Tracing Integration:**
```rust
tracing::info!(
    "ðŸ¤– Lead/Worker Mode Enabled: Lead model (first 3 turns): {}, Worker model (turn 4+): {}, Auto-fallback on failures: Enabled",
    lead_model,
    worker_model
);
```

**Session Header Display:**
```
starting session | provider: openai lead model: gpt-4o worker model: gpt-4o-mini
```
Instead of:
```
starting session | provider: openai model: gpt-4o-mini
```

### âœ… Turn-by-Turn Logging
- `"Using lead (initial) provider for turn 1 (lead_turns: 3)"`
- `"Using worker provider for turn 4 (lead_turns: 3)"`
- `"ðŸ”„ Using lead (fallback) provider for turn 7 (FALLBACK MODE: 1 turns remaining)"`

### âœ… Fallback Mode Logging
- `"ðŸ”„ SWITCHING TO LEAD MODEL: Entering fallback mode after 2 consecutive task failures"`
- `"âœ… SWITCHING BACK TO WORKER MODEL: Exiting fallback mode - worker model resumed"`

### âœ… Configuration Support
- Environment variables (simple setup)
- YAML configuration (advanced setup with cross-provider support)
- Proper precedence handling

## Testing

### Unit Tests
- All existing tests pass
- Added comprehensive test coverage for lead/worker functionality
- Verified switch-back logic with detailed test output

### Integration Tests
- Created test scripts for manual verification
- Confirmed startup logging works correctly
- Verified model switching behavior

## Code Quality

### âœ… Compilation
- Code compiles without errors or warnings
- All dependencies resolved correctly

### âœ… Formatting
- Code follows Rust formatting standards
- `cargo fmt --check` passes

### âœ… Testing
- All unit tests pass
- Test coverage includes edge cases and error conditions

## Usage Examples

### Simple Setup
```bash
export GOOSE_PROVIDER="openai"
export GOOSE_MODEL="gpt-4o-mini"
export GOOSE_LEAD_MODEL="gpt-4o"
```

### Advanced YAML Setup
```yaml
provider: openai
model: gpt-4o-mini
lead_worker:
  enabled: true
  lead_model: gpt-4o
  lead_turns: 3
  failure_threshold: 2
  fallback_turns: 2
```

## Benefits Delivered

1. **Complete Visibility** - Users can see exactly which models are configured and active
2. **Real-time Monitoring** - Turn-by-turn logging shows model switching behavior  
3. **Failure Transparency** - Clear indication when fallback mode is triggered and resolved
4. **Easy Debugging** - Comprehensive logging helps troubleshoot configuration issues
5. **User-Friendly** - Clear, emoji-enhanced messages that are easy to understand
