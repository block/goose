prompt: |
  Analyze {{ directory }} and generate file statistics:
  
  1. Count total files by extension (.rs, .yaml, .md, .toml, etc.)
  2. Calculate total lines of code across all text files
  3. Determine total file sizes
  4. Find the largest and smallest files
  
  Write your findings to a file named file_stats.json with this structure:
  ```json
  {
    "total_files": <number>,
    "files_by_extension": {
      ".rs": <count>,
      ".yaml": <count>,
      ...
    },
    "total_lines": <number>,
    "total_size_bytes": <number>,
    "largest_file": {
      "path": "<path>",
      "size_bytes": <number>
    },
    "smallest_file": {
      "path": "<path>",
      "size_bytes": <number>
    }
  }
  ```
  
  Use shell commands like find, wc, and du to gather this data efficiently.
