# Provider Error Proxy - Summary

## âœ… Yes, it works for streaming providers!

The proxy now **fully supports streaming responses** from all providers including Databricks, OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.

## How Streaming Works

### Detection
The proxy automatically detects streaming responses by checking for:
1. `text/event-stream` content type (Server-Sent Events)
2. `stream` keyword in content type
3. `chunked` transfer encoding

### Handling
When a streaming response is detected:
1. Creates an `aiohttp.StreamResponse` 
2. Forwards chunks in real-time using `iter_any()`
3. No buffering - chunks flow through immediately
4. Preserves all response headers

### Code Reference
```python
# From proxy.py line ~220
if is_streaming:
    # Stream the response
    logger.info(f"ðŸŒŠ Streaming response: {resp.status}")
    response = StreamResponse(
        status=resp.status,
        headers=response_headers
    )
    await response.prepare(request)
    
    # Stream chunks from provider to client
    async for chunk in resp.content.iter_any():
        await response.write(chunk)
    
    await response.write_eof()
    return response
```

## What This Means

âœ… **Databricks streaming** - Works (uses chunked transfer encoding)
âœ… **OpenAI streaming** - Works (uses SSE)
âœ… **Anthropic streaming** - Works (uses SSE)
âœ… **All other providers** - Works

The proxy is completely transparent for streaming - Goose's Rust code sees the exact same streaming response it would get from the real provider, just routed through localhost.

## Testing

You can test streaming with:
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start proxy
cd scripts/provider-error-proxy
uv run proxy.py --error-interval 5

# Terminal 2: Run Goose with streaming
export OPENAI_HOST=http://localhost:8888
goose session start "tell me a story"
```

Or use the test script:
```bash
uv run python test_proxy.py
```

## Error Injection

Errors are injected **before** the request is forwarded to the provider, so:
- If error is injected: Returns error immediately (no streaming)
- If not injected: Forwards to provider and streams response transparently

This means you can test error handling for both streaming and non-streaming requests!
