### 3. Figma MCP Server (VERIFIED ✅)

## MCP Servers Audited (56 total)

### High Priority - Requires Attention
1. **Brave Search** - ✅ Fixed (deprecated warning added)
2. **Puppeteer** - ✅ Fixed (documentation link corrected)

### Medium Priority - Should Monitor
1. **JetBrains MCP** - Documentation updated to reflect native IDE integration in 2025.2+
2. **Various Community MCPs** - Some may need periodic verification

### Low Priority - Well Maintained
- Tavily Search, Browserbase, MongoDB, ElevenLabs, Chrome DevTools
- All other 50+ MCP servers are actively maintained and properly documented

## Recommendations for Future Maintenance

### Quarterly Review Tasks
1. **Check MCP Server Status**: Verify key repositories are still active
2. **Test Installation Commands**: Ensure npx commands still work
3. **Update Documentation**: Add/remove deprecation warnings as needed
4. **Link Validation**: Verify all GitHub links are still valid

### Automated Monitoring
1. **GitHub API Monitoring**: Check for archived repositories
2. **Link Checking**: Automated validation of all external links
3. **Package Registry Monitoring**: Verify npm packages still exist
