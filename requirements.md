You are to look at adapting the best bits of pi to the goose agent code here (in rust). 

There is some analysis in ~/Development/research/pi-research/ you can look it - it refers to a few agents but we are focussing on the core bits of pi. There is a draft plan in there. 

The source code to pi is ~/Documents/code/pi/pi-mono if you ened to refer to it. 

You should
* plan how to achieve this in the goose rust codebase here to improve it and note that plan down in plan.md and keep it up dated
* implement this, noting how to test things as you go reasonably

This is really about improving how goose is, vs rewriting unless necessary. 
The system prompts and many things like that may have to change
This could well be a simplification or ablation of things from goose which are no longer needed.
