Successfully added xAI provider support for Grok models to Goose:

**What was implemented:**
1. Created new XaiProvider in `crates/goose/src/providers/xai.rs`

3. Uses x.ai's OpenAI-compatible API at https://api.x.ai/v1/chat/completions
4. Requires XAI_API_KEY environment variable
5. Optional XAI_HOST configuration (defaults to https://api.x.ai)
6. Updated provider factory and registry to include xAI
7. Added xAI to GUI provider registry in ProviderRegistry.tsx
8. Includes proper error handling for auth, rate limits, server errors

**How to use:**
- CLI: Set XAI_API_KEY env var, then use `--provider xai --model grok-3`
- GUI: Configure xAI provider in Settings with API key

**Key files modified:**
