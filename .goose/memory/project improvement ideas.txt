# ["xai", "grok", "provider", "implementation", "complete"]
Successfully added xAI provider support for Grok models to Goose:

**What was implemented:**
1. Created new XaiProvider in `crates/goose/src/providers/xai.rs`
2. Added support for all Grok models: grok-3, grok-3-fast, grok-3-mini, grok-3-mini-fast, grok-2-vision-1212, grok-2-image-1212, etc.
3. Uses x.ai's OpenAI-compatible API at https://api.x.ai/v1/chat/completions
4. Requires XAI_API_KEY environment variable
5. Optional XAI_HOST configuration (defaults to https://api.x.ai)
6. Updated provider factory and registry to include xAI
7. Added xAI to GUI provider registry in ProviderRegistry.tsx
8. Includes proper error handling for auth, rate limits, server errors

**How to use:**
- CLI: Set XAI_API_KEY env var, then use `--provider xai --model grok-3`
- GUI: Configure xAI provider in Settings with API key

**Key files modified:**
- crates/goose/src/providers/xai.rs (new)
- crates/goose/src/providers/mod.rs (added xai module)
- crates/goose/src/providers/factory.rs (added XaiProvider to registry)
- ui/desktop/src/components/settings/providers/ProviderRegistry.tsx (added xAI UI config)

# ["xai", "fix", "endpoint", "url", "api"]
Fixed critical issue with xAI provider endpoint URL:

**Problem:** 
Getting 404 error when using xAI provider because of incorrect API endpoint construction.

**Root Cause:**
The code was constructing URL as: `https://api.x.ai` + `v1/chat/completions` = `https://api.x.ai/v1/chat/completions`
But x.ai API documentation shows the base URL should be `https://api.x.ai/v1` and then append `chat/completions`.

**Solution:**
1. Changed `XAI_API_HOST` from `"https://api.x.ai"` to `"https://api.x.ai/v1"`
2. Updated URL joining to append `"chat/completions"` instead of `"v1/chat/completions"`
3. Updated UI provider registry default host to match
4. Tested with curl - now returns proper 400 auth error instead of 404

**Additional Issue Found:**
User had `GOOSE_LEAD_MODEL: claude-opus-4-20250514` in config which was triggering lead/worker mode. This model doesn't exist, causing cascade failures. Recommend removing or updating to valid model.

**Status:** Fixed and committed (commit 30dbcba3e4)
