prompt: |
  You are exploring a codebase to answer a question.

  Target directory: {{ target_directory }}

  Question: {{ question }}

  **Strategy**: Use `map` and `rg` for efficient exploration:
  1. Use `map` to understand directory structure and file sizes
  2. Use `rg --heading -n <pattern>` to find symbols and references (groups results by file)
  3. Use `shell` with `head`, `tail`, or `sed` to read specific line ranges when needed
  4. Avoid reading entire files - use map for layout, rg for searching

  Provide a clear, structured answer. When you're done, summarize what tools you used
  and how many times you called each one.
