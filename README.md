goose is a **sophisticated enterprise AI agent framework** in Rust with CLI and Electron desktop interfaces, featuring advanced multi-agent orchestration, specialist agents, and enterprise workflow automation. **Phase 5: Enterprise Integration is now 100% complete**, delivering a production-ready autonomous development platform.

## 🚀 **Enterprise Multi-Agent Platform**
- **AgentOrchestrator**: Coordinates multiple specialist AI agents for complex workflows
- **Specialist Agents**: Code, Testing, Deployment, Documentation, and Security specialists
- **WorkflowEngine**: Pre-built enterprise development pipelines (Full-Stack, Microservices, DevOps)
- **Advanced Planning**: Multi-step execution with self-critique and quality validation

## 🎯 **Advanced Autonomous Capabilities**
- **Structured Execution**: STATE graph-driven autonomous development with validation gates
- **Self-Correcting Loops**: Automatic CODE→TEST→FIX→DONE workflows with quality assurance
- **Enterprise Security**: Multi-level approval policies with environment-aware command execution
- **MCP Integration**: Seamless integration with external tools (Playwright, OpenHands, Aider)

Whether you're building enterprise applications, managing complex development pipelines, or coordinating multiple AI agents for large-scale projects, goose provides the sophisticated orchestration and autonomous execution needed for modern software development.

Designed for maximum flexibility and enterprise deployment, goose works with any LLM, supports multi-model configuration, integrates with MCP servers, and provides both desktop and CLI interfaces - making it the ultimate AI development platform for teams who want to scale their development velocity.
