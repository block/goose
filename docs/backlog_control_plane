#### 3. **Admin Dashboard (future)**

An admin using the desktop app could manage the control plane:

| Feature | Endpoint | UI Surface |
|---|---|---|
| View policies | `GET /control-plane/v1/policies` | Settings → Policies panel |
| Set quotas | `POST /control-plane/v1/quotas` | Settings → Usage & Limits |
| View audit log | `GET /control-plane/v1/audit/events` | Activity → Audit Trail |
| Manage agents | `GET /control-plane/v1/agents` | Settings → Agent Registry |

### What Needs to Change in the Desktop App

**Immediate (for enterprise compatibility):**

1. **Handle 403/429 responses gracefully** — the `authInterceptor.ts` already intercepts requests, but doesn't handle policy denials or quota errors. It should show user-friendly messages instead of generic errors.

2. **Surface rate limit info** — When `429` comes back, the response includes `limit` and `used` values. Show a "You've reached your limit (X/Y). Resets in Z minutes." message.

**Optional (admin UI):**

3. **Control Plane settings page** — only shown if the user has admin roles
4. **Audit trail viewer** — real-time event feed via the `BroadcastSink`

Want me to:
- **A)** Add 403/429 error handling to the desktop's `authInterceptor.ts`?
- **B)** Generate the OpenAPI spec (`just generate-openapi`) so the frontend SDK picks up the new endpoints?
- **C)** Build an admin control plane UI page?
- **D)** All of the above?
