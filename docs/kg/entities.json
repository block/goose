This removes trailing spaces from partial token chunks, causing words to merge when concatenated. E.g., 'I\\'ve ' + 'read ' + 'and ' -> trim each -> 'I\\'ve' + 'read' + 'and' -> 'I\\'vereadand'",

      "NOTE: The earlier CSS fix (break-all -> break-word) in the OLD markdown files was correct but those files no longer exist \u2014 the CURRENT MarkdownContent.tsx at a different path still has break-all",
      "CORRECTED ANALYSIS after full deep-dive:",
      "ROOT CAUSE 1 (CRITICAL - CONFIRMED): strip_tool_call_tags() in message.rs applies .trim() unconditionally to EVERY text content block in EVERY streaming delta message. Since providers yield per-token deltas (not accumulated text), trailing spaces on token chunks like 'Hello ' get trimmed to 'Hello'. When the frontend concatenates these trimmed deltas via pushMessage (lastContent.text += newContent.text), spaces between words are permanently lost.",
      "ROOT CAUSE 2 (MODERATE - CONFIRMED): GooseMessage.tsx stripInternalTags() also calls .trim() on the final concatenated text. While this only trims leading/trailing whitespace of the full string (not internal), it compounds with RC1.",
      "ROOT CAUSE 3 (MINOR - CONFIRMED): CSS break-all exists in 4 locations in CURRENT MarkdownContent.tsx: line 99 (SyntaxHighlighter codeTagProps wordBreak: 'break-all'), line 140 (inline code className='break-all'), line 182 (prose-code:break-all), line 183 (prose-a:break-all). The earlier fix was applied to OLD files that no longer exist.",
      "ROOT CAUSE 4 (MINOR): getTextAndImageContent() concatenates text blocks without separator (textContent += content.text). During streaming, pushMessage merges same-ID messages by appending text, so this mainly affects multi-text-block non-streaming messages.",
      "IMPORTANT CORRECTION: The earlier CSS fix (commit f494e35f) was applied to files that NO LONGER EXIST (old /components/markdown/MarkdownContent.tsx and overrideStyles.css). The CURRENT MarkdownContent.tsx is at /components/MarkdownContent.tsx and still has break-all."
